# whack-a-mole

For this project I want to create whack a mole.

There will be a timer of 1 minute. 
I want to have 3 difficulties. These will be how long the mole stays out, and maybe how many there are to hit
Each time a mole is clicked then a point will be given.
I want the moles to come out randomly. For now they will be in fixed positions in the middle of the screen, but if possible I want to have them appear randomly on the screen
